        format: date-time
        description: |
          Identifies the date/time of when the file was posted/published, in RFC3339 format.
          The publication date/time is critical for subscribers to prevent message loss by knowing
          their lag (how far behind the publisher they are).
      data_id: 
        type: string
        description: |
         Unique identifier of the data as defined by the data producer.
         Data producers SHOULD NOT use an opaque id, but something meaningful to support client side filtering.
      metadata_id:
        type: string
        description: |
         Identifier for associated discovery metadata record to which the notification applies to.
         The identification SHOULD be from a WCMP2 discovery metadata record identifier from the WIS2
         Global Discovery Catalogue. Identifiers based on external catalogue systems MAY be articulated as additional links.
      producer:
        type: string
        description: |
          Identifies the provider that initially captured and processed the source data, in support of data distribution on behalf of other Members.

        description: Identifies the end date/time date of the data being published, in RFC3339 format.
      cache:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Whether the data in the notification should be cached (if not specified, the default value is `true`).
          When set to `false`, WIS2 Global Cache services do not cache the canonical link, and publish the
          notification with an unmodified canonical link (which points back to the endpoint as specified by the data producer).
          The notification is always published by the Global Cache regardless to the `cache` topic.
