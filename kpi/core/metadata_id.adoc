=== WCMP dataset record identification

==== WCMP properties

* `properties.metadata_id`

==== Rationale for measurement

The metadata identifier provides linkage to the associated discovery metadata in the GDC and provides traceability to the overall dataset description.

==== Measurement

Whether WCMP discovery metadata information is available and can be successfully identified.

==== Guidance to score well on this assessment

* Provide an identifier of the associated WCMP dataset record in the Global Discovery Catalogue

==== Rules
