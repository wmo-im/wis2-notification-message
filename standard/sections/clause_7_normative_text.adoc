== The WIS2 Notification Message Encoding

A WIS2 Notification Message provides descriptive information about a data made available
through WIS 2.0.

=== Conformance Class Core

==== Overview

This Core Conformance Class provides requirements to articulate the required elements of a WIS2 Notification Message.

include::../requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

The standard notification message format ensures that the WIS2 ecosystem (data publisher, data user, and global services) is a robust, effective, and unified data exchange platform for weather, climate, and water.

==== GeoJSON compliance

The WIS2 Notification Message schema is based on _GeoJSON_ (RFC7946) and its associated information model.  Compliant messages are therefore compliant with _GeoJSON_.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_validation.adoc[]

==== Identifier

A universally unique identifier of the message using the UUID standard (RFC4122). The identifier is generated by the originator of the message.
It provides the anti-loop feature that is needed to ensure that the message will be seen once by all Global Brokers.
It remains the same throughout the lifetime of the message in the WIS2 ecosystem.

The message identifier is set to a new value by Global Cache services when they publish their modified message for accessing the original core
data from the cache. The <<data_id>> is retained to ensure traceability and consistency of the same resource.

==== Version

The ``version`` property provides the version of WNM that the message conforms to.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_version.adoc[]

==== Type

The ``type`` property is a fixed value denoting the record as a GeoJSON Feature.

include::../requirements/core/REQ_type.adoc[]

==== Geometry

RFC7946 defines 7 types of geometry: ``Point``, ``MultiPoint``, ``LineString``, ``MultiLineString``, ``Polygon``, ``MultiPolygon``, and ``GeometryCollection``.
It has been decided to restrict those types to only two: ``Point`` and ``Polygon``.
It must be noted that the geometry key is mandatory in GeoJSON but can be of type ``null``.

==== Properties

===== pubtime

The ``pubtime`` property identifies the date/time of when the file was posted/published, in RFC3339 format, in
the UTC timezone (``Z``). The publication date/time is critical for subscribers to prevent message loss in
providing awareness of how far behind the publisher they may be).

[source,json]
----
"properties": {
  ...
  "pubtime": "2022-03-20T04:50:18.314854383Z"
  ...
}
----

include::../requirements/core/REQ_pubtime.adoc[]

[[data_id]]
===== data_id

The ``data_id`` property uniquely identifies the data. It is comprised of two parts:

1. the topic where the message will be published as defined in https://community.wmo.int/wis2-topic-hierarchy, removing both the channel (origin or cache) and the version of the topic hierarchy.
2. a unique identifier of the data. It can be the filename used by the originating center or a unique UUID (RFC4122) or a value chosen
by the originating center as long as it is unique over a 1 week period

include::../requirements/core/REQ_data_id.adoc[]

  ...
}
----

===== Temporal description (datetime, start_datetime, end_datetime)

The ``datetime`` property identifies the date and time of the data being published (e.g. date of measurement, for observation data), in RFC3339 format, in the UTC timezone (``Z``).

The ``start_datetime`` and ``end_datetime`` properties identify a temporal extent (e.g. start/end times for an NWP forecasting period), in RFC3339 format, in the UTC timezone (``Z``). 

include::../requirements/core/REQ_temporal.adoc[]

.Example: Temporal instant

  "end_datetime": "2022-03-22T04:45:00Z"
  ...
}
----

===== Integrity

For data verification, it is suggested (but not mandatory) to include data integrity information via the ``integrity`` property.  Providing this information will allow data consumers to ensure
that a given data granule has not been corrupted during download.

The ``method`` property provides a format of the hashing method used to enable integrity check of the data. Acceptable values
are ``md5``, ``sha256`` and ``sha512``.  ``sha512`` is preferred.

The ``value`` property provides the result of the hashing method.

include::../recommendations/core/REC_integrity.adoc[]

[source,json]
----
"properties": {
  ...
  "integrity": {
    "method": "sha512",
    "value": "3bb12eda3c298db5de25597f54d924f2e17e78a26ad89...b0124ecb8a"
  }
  ...
}
----

===== Content

For data granules with sizes smaller than 2048 bytes, the ``content`` property allows for including the data in the message. The ``content`` property provides an additional inline data access capability, in addition to a canonical link of the message.

The ``encoding`` property provides the character encoding of the data (fixed to UTF-8 or Base64).

The ``value`` property provides the data in the in accordance to the ``encoding`` property.

The ``size`` property provides the size of the data in accordance to the ``encoding`` property. The value must be below 2048. Global Brokers may discard messages for where inline data sizes are greater than 2048 bytes.

"properties": {
  ...
  "content": {
    "encoding": "utf-8",
    "value": "encoded bytes from the file",
    "size": 457
  }
  ...
}
----

===== Additional properties

A WIS2 Notification Message can be extended as required for organizational purposes by adding properties (of any type) in the message. Additional properties do not break compliance to this specification.

  ...
  "_comment": {
    "validationErrors": [
      "error 1",
      "error 2"
    ]
  }
  ...
}
----

==== Links

The ``links`` array consists of one or more objects providing URLs to access data.

Each link object provides:

* an ``href`` property with a fully qualified link to access the data in a secure manner
* a ``rel`` property providing an IANA link relation footnote:[https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml] describing the relationship between the link and the message
* a ``type`` property providing the media type of the data
* a ``length`` property providing the length (in bytes) indicating the size of the data in the response when downloading the link.
