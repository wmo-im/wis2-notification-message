=== WCMP dataset record identification

==== WCMP element(s)

* `properties.metadata_id`

==== What is being measured

Whether WCMP discovery metadata information is available and can be successfully identified.

==== Rationale for measurement

Providing linkage to the associated discovery metadata in a WNM provides traceability to the overall dataset description.

==== Rules for implementation

.Metadata identification implementation rules
|===
|Rule |Score

|The `+properties.metadata_id+` property is present
|1

|The metadata identifier resolves to a valid WCMP record in the Global Discovery Catalogue
|1
|===

*Total possible score: 2 (100%)*

==== Guidance to score well on this assessment

* Provide an identifier of the associated WCMP dataset record in the Global Discovery Catalogue

==== Examples 


```json
"properties": {
  ...
  "metadata_id": "urn:x-wmo:md:ca-eccc-msc:observations.swob"
  ...
}
```
